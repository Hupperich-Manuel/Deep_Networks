# Deep_Networks
***This is only a small part that comprises a leveraged analysis of stocks, where you only have to put the ticker you are interested in, and the dates, and the programm returns the result of an adjusted Deep Nerual Network for Prediction. Moreover, I am currently working on a Java application which aimes to make this all more easy to visualize, specially for those who are not that familiar with coding.***
Unadjusted Deep Neural Network for Apple Stocks
In order to properly explain my analysis, I will go through each of the files independently and then, join them together and see how they work harmoniously together for a test accuracy.
First of all, we need to get the input layers. It has been historically prooved that aiming to get the real intrinsic value of a stock, one has to study its fundamentals. Therefore, I picked up several ratios which cover from the eranings ratios as the Price Earning Ratio to liquidity ratios, e.g.: the Current Ratio. 
The outcome y_hat which I used to train the model where the stock prices from Apple. Accroding to an article published from [applyed science](file:///Users/usuario/Downloads/applsci-10-08142-v2.pdf) .
