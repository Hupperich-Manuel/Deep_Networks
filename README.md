Unadjusted Deep Neural Network for Apple Stocks
In order to properly explain my analysis, I will go through each of the files independently and then, join them together and see how they work harmoniously together for a test accuracy.
First of all, we need to get the input layers. It has been historically prooved that aiming to get the real intrinsic value of a stock, one has to study its fundamentals. Therefore, I picked up several ratios which cover from the eranings ratios as the Price Earning Ratio to liquidity ratios, e.g.: the Current Ratio. 
The outcome y_hat which I used to train the model where the stock prices from Apple. Accroding to an article published from [applyed science](file:///Users/usuario/Downloads/applsci-10-08142-v2.pdf).
